## Description
Our goal  was to create an application to to post short ideas and have other employees like and remove the like from that idea. In backend, we were able to create a server that provided several routes through which a user can post new ideas and like ideas. Through admin, we were able to create a table and drop/delete a table. Lastly, through the front end, we were able to create a user interface to allow the users to see all the new ideas, create their own, and like or dislike an idea. 

## How to Build and Run
We will build and run the application by going to the respective branches names below and the following:
Backend: mvn package; mvn heroku:deploy
Frontend: F5

## Backend Learning
- made sure the name of the page is whispering-sands-78580
- data clips allow us to check the database from heroku

## Unit Tests
### Backend:
- Code actually updates or subtracts 1 for like or dislike
- Records can be added to database
- Connects to postgres


### Frontend:
- Add button on press -> goes to text field
- Submit button adds idea field onto list
- Upvote button adds to vote counter
- Downvote button subtracts from vote counter (votes > 1)
- Downvote button does not subtract from vote counter for no votes

### Admin:
- Test that database was created correctly
- Test that database was deleted correctly
- Test that rows were removed correctly
